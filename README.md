# RegEx Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use RegEx to detect patterns in strings

## Instructions

This is a test driven ruby lab designed to get you comfortable using RegEx in combination with the `.match` and `.scan` methods. Run `learn test` and build out your methods in regex_lab.rb

Hint: You can use [rubular.com](https://rubular.com "Rubular") as a handy tool to test your regular expressions as you write them.
